## Description

Inspection King is an introduction app into what potential to increase efficiency for local governments.  Typically a building permit is issued then the contractor has to contact the inspection department to request inspections that are required for, solar, electrical, final inspection, etc..Inspection King gives contractors the ability to schedule inspections, and city officials the ability to add updates and approve existing inspections.

## Planned Features

Eventually I would like the ability to add invoice payment on the resident side. More hardcoded statuses instead off strings also the ability to allow users to upload custom images. Stretch goals would be to allow the ability to issue updated building plans and in-app messaging between officials.
